# Spacecowboy

*Lightweight decision-making for distributed agile teams.*


## What is it?


*Spacecowboy* is a tool for making quick decisions in a distributed team leveraging the *wisdom of the crowd*.  Typical use cases include effort or cost estimation, triage decisions and evaluating a proposal.  It is used together with other collaboration tools, such as a conferencing system or a work tracking system.

Playing *Spacecowboy* typically goes like this:

1. Somebody creates a place, giving it a name, and selects a card deck suitable for the type of decisions to be made.  He then shares the link to the place with the other participants.

2. All participants creates an avatar to represent them in the game.

3. The session facilitator reads the decision to be made.  All participants pick the card that best represents their vote on the decision.

4. When everybody has voted, all votes are revealed to all participants.  Maybe we have agreement at once, or maybe there needs to be some discussion about the differences in the votes.  If necessary, reset the votes and start again.

5. If there are more decisions to be made, go back to step 3.

*Spacecowboy* is always available at [https://spacecowboy.app/](https://spacecowboy.app/).  Use it as much as you can!
